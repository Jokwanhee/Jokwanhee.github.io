1. **CI/CD via GitHub Actions**  
   On every push to the `main` branch, the app is built using `wasmJsBrowserDistribution` and deployed automatically to GitHub Pages.

2. **Secure Secret Handling**  
   Supabase credentials are stored as GitHub Secrets, and a `Key.kt` file is generated dynamically during the CI process.
